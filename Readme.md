# Language Playground

This repository serves as a personal playground for experimenting with different programming languages and testing various functionalities. Each folder is dedicated to a specific language and contains random scripts, code snippets, or small projects that I found interesting or wanted to try out.

## Structure

- Each top-level folder is named after a programming language (e.g., `python`, `javascript`, `go`, `java`, etc.).
- Inside each folder, youâ€™ll find scripts or examples demonstrating features, libraries, or patterns that I wanted to test or explore.

## Purpose

- To experiment freely with different languages and libraries.
- To keep a collection of useful code samples and test cases for future reference.
- To learn and document interesting functionalities or behaviors.

## Notes

- Code quality and organization may vary, as this is a space for quick tests and ideas.
- Most files are not intended for production use.
- Feel free to explore or use any snippet you find helpful.

Happy coding!
